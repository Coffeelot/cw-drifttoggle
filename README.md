# Drift while holding a button
### **See the script in action on [Sundown RP](https://discord.gg/CZNh8kcSGK) üåÜ**

Simple and easy. Hold a button and allow more sliding and fun driving.

Default is left ctrl (or at least in the code it is - mine ended up being left alt for some reason), but you can change it to whatever in keyboard binds in settings.
