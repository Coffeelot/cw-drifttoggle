# Drift while holding a button
Simple and easy. Hold a button and allow more sliding and fun driving.

Default is left ctrl (or at least in the code it is - mine ended up being left alt for some reason), but you can change it to whatever in keyboard binds in settings.

You you want to check for drift mode in other scripts you can use the export `driftIsOn`. Useful if you want to for example add a TCS icon to your HUD

Example use: 
```lua
local driftModeIsOn = exports['cw-drifttoggle']:driftIsOn()
```
